# Trivadda!

Trivadda is a front-end project and aims to create a beautiful, simple app for trivia fun. There are tons of questions with multiple categories including:
* Art
* Anime and Manga
* Video Games
* Celebrities
* Mythology
* Music
* Animals
* Book
* Films
* Sport
* Television

Trivadda was made with the React framework and sports a gorgeous and clean design. 

The design has a base in the Material philosophy. Although it adheres to simplicity and effects, but there is also some complexity added to it via gradients and enhanced background image. The elements are also spaced widely for better aesthetic outlook.

Try it yourself and you would find yourself lost in it!
